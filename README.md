# SKA Mining: Decentralized Structured Knowledge Accumulation

## Overview

SKA Mining is a groundbreaking research project that combines Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) neural networks with blockchain technology to create a decentralized framework for mining, validating, and sharing structured knowledge.

Unlike traditional cryptocurrency mining that solves arbitrary computational puzzles, SKA Mining participants contribute to collective intelligence by accumulating structured knowledge from freely available information on the internet. This knowledge is then validated, stored, and shared through blockchain technology.

## Core Concepts

### Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)

SKA is a novel neural learning framework based on information theory that redefines learning as a continuous process of knowledge accumulation. Key features:

- Forward-only learning without backpropagation
- Layer-wise entropy minimization: $H^{l} = \displaystyle -\frac{1}{ln(2)} \int z dD$
- Natural equilibrium condition via Tensor Net function
- Sigmoid activation as an emergent property of entropy reduction

### Knowledge Mining

In this framework, "mining" refers to:
- Extracting structured knowledge from raw information
- Using SKA networks to reduce entropy and organize information
- Contributing valuable knowledge representations to the collective

### Blockchain Knowledge Storage

The blockchain component provides:
- Decentralized verification of knowledge contributions
- Immutable record of knowledge evolution
- Incentive mechanisms for knowledge miners
- Transparent, open access to accumulated knowledge

## Research Objectives

1. Develop a decentralized protocol for SKA-based knowledge mining
2. Create metrics for evaluating knowledge contribution value
3. Design consensus mechanisms for knowledge validation
4. Implement efficient encoding of tensor representations for blockchain storage
5. Build a prototype system demonstrating distributed knowledge accumulation

## Theoretical Foundation

The SKA Mining project is built on the governing differential equation of SKA:

$$∇H^{l} + \displaystyle \frac{1}{ln(2)} z^{l}_k ⊙ D'^{l}_k + ΔD^{l}_k = 0$$

This equation defines how knowledge is structured across distributed nodes, with the Tensor Net function (∫ (D-H)dZ) providing a principled criterion for when knowledge has been optimally structured.

## Potential Applications

- Decentralized large language models (LLMs)
- Collaborative knowledge bases with verifiable contributions
- Open-source AI systems with distributed development
- Real-time adaptive AI that continuously accumulates knowledge
